/// In the model of yatp, any piece of logic aiming to be executed in a thread
/// pool is called Task. There can be different definitions of Task. Some people
/// may choose `Future` as Task, some may just want callbacks, or even Actor
/// messages. But no matter what a Task is, there should be some role know how
/// to execute it. The role is call `Runner`.
///
/// The life cycle of a Runner is:
/// ```text
///   start
///     |
///     | <--- resume
///     |        |
///   handle -> pause
///     |
///    end
/// ```
///
/// Generally users should use the provided future thread pool or callback
/// thread pool instead. This is only for advance customization.

    ///
